1. Need to figure out how to include variance measures in the age intensity profile estimation.
2. Need to do some sanity checks to figure out if the fitting method can actually recover known parameters.
3. Need to use the estimated parameters to explore the efficacy of management strategies. 
4. Need to perform sensitivity analyses on some of these parameters. 

Some other thoughts

1. It would probably be significantly faster to run this model in C or C++.  However, does it make sense to re-learn C and re-code this model, or run with it as is?  We can parallelize the R code, but with my rudimentary parallelizing skills it is not an insane gain in speed.  But would we really gain much speed in C++? I need to re-learn it anyway, so it could be a good excuse...
